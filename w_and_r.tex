\section{Analysis of Design Constraints - A Case Study}\label{sec:w_and_r}

In this section, we study the effect of various schemes on cross-point
ReRAM arrays in detail. Specifically, we evaluate the design constraints
on array size, energy consumption and area overhead in worst case
scenarios. The results of this study will be useful when designing a
cross-point array.

\vspace{-10pt}
\subsection{Overview}
%As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:modeling}, i
In order to write or read a cross-point array, proper voltages should be
applied across the ReRAM cell. Although the goal of a read operation is
different from a write operation, both of them are realized by fully
biasing the selected wordlines/bitlines and floating (or half biasing)
unselected wordlines/bitlines. Thus, the coefficient matrix $A$ and the
constant vector $C$ are very similar for both. In addition, their energy
consumption and area overhead will also have a similar trend. Therefore,
in this section, we first study the write operation comprehensively. After
that, for read operation, we mainly focus on the read margin analysis
since it is unique for read operations.
%can be very useful to guide the design of the cross-point array.
%Also, we assumes that the in the case of worst scenario, the ReRAM cells at the selected wordline, th
%Since it is impossible to consider all of the data pattern stored in the array,

Table~\ref{table:parameter} shows the circuit parameters of our baseline
50nm design. The data is derived from the recently published studies on
ReRAM~\cite{ReRAM_overview,memristor:Cong,ReRAM_Renesas}. The nonlinearity
coefficient is defined as
\begin{equation}
K_r(p,V) = p \times R(V/p)/R(V),
\end{equation}
where $R(V/p)$ and $R(V)$ are the equivalent resistance of the cell biased
at $V/p$ and $V$~\cite{memristor:Cong}. Therefore, the resistance of a
ReRAM cell with nonlinearity is not constant but varies with the applied
voltage. For example, for a ReRAM cell with nonlinearity of 20, the
resistance of half biased cell is 10 times larger than resistance of fully
biased cell. By using these parameters, we study reliability, energy
consumption, and area overheads for four different write schemes, and
discuss the sensitivities of these schemes to the data pattern of HRS and
LRS ReRAM cells and cell nonlinearity. In this section, the baseline
design uses a cell with write current of $40 uA$ and nonlinearity $Kr=20$.
A sensitivity study varying the nonlinearity coefficient and the write
current is presented in Section~\ref{sec:scale}.

\subsection{Write Operation}
To write a ReRAM cell, an external voltage is applied across the cell for
a certain duration. Intuitively, there are four possible schemes for the
write operation: \emph{FWFB} scheme activates the selected wordline and
selected bitline, and leaves all of other lines floating; \emph{FWHB}
scheme activates the selected wordline and bitline, leaves all the
unselected wordlines floating, and half biases the unselected bitlines;
\emph{HWFB} scheme activates the selected wordline and bitline, leaves all
the unselected bitlines floating, and half biases the unselected
wordlines; \emph{HWHB} scheme activates the selected wordline and bitline,
and half biases the unselected wordlines and bitlines. However, the FWFB
scheme has an inherent problem that may result in severe write
disturbance~\cite{crossbar_NANO2003_Ziegler}. Therefore, in the following
discussion, we only compare the results of the FWHB, HWFB and HWHB
schemes. For each of these three schemes, we can either write several
cells on one wordline at the same time (multi-bit write) or write only one
bit per access (single-bit write) and distribute the write operation to
several arrays. In the following discussion, we start from single-bit
write operation, and then the results of multi-bit write method are
discussed.

%Since several potential read/write schemes can be used to program a memory array, it is difficult to identify the ideal scheme that meets the design constraints in terms of area, energy, and reliability.
%However, the FWFB scheme has inherent problem that may result in severe
%write disturbance. For example, for writing a ReRAM cell located at the
%cross point of the $i^{nd}$ wordline and the $j^{nd}$ bitline in a $M
%\times N$ matrix ($M>N$), the worst case voltage drop of unselected cells
%appears when all of the ReRAM cells at the selected bitline are in the
%HRS, while all of the other cells are in the LRS. In this case, the
%voltage drop across the selected cell almost has the same magnitude as the
%unselected cell at the same bitline, resulting the write disturbance to
%all of the unselected cells at the selected bitline. Actually, the worst
%case voltage drop of the unselected cell can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}\label{worst_FWFB}
%V_{worst}=V_{select} \cdot [1-\frac{1}{M+(N-1)R_{off}/R_{on}}].
%\end{equation}
%Considering that the reported On-OFF resistance ratio of ReRAM cell is
%always $>50$
%~\cite{ReRAM_IEDM2010_Ho,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Chien,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Diode,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Evidence,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Sheu,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Otsuka},
%, the worst case voltage drop at the unselected cell is larger than $98\%$
%of the voltage at the selected cell, making it is impossible to build a
%reliable cross-point structure ReRAM with the FWFB scheme. Therefore, in
%the following discussion, we only compare the results of FWHB, HWFB and
%HWHB schemes. For each of these three schemes, we can either write several
%cells at one wordline at the same time or only write one bit per access
%and distribute the write operation to several arrays. In the following
%discussion, we start from one bit per access write operation, then the
%results of one wordline per access method are discussed.

%Since reliability, energy consumption, and area overheads for these
%schemes are different, we address these problems separately and finally
%combine all constraints to provide design guidelines for write operations.


\vspace{5pt}\noindent\textbf{Reliable Write Operations.} Write reliability
is a serious concern in cross-point arrays. In an ideal condition, the
resistance of wires and the sneak currents in unselected cells are
negligible. In such a scenario, all the write schemes discussed above can
make sure that the write voltage $V_W(W)-V_B(W)$ is fully applied across
the specified cell. However, in reality, both wire resistance and sneak
current are non-trivial. Hence, the voltage applied across a cross-point
varies based on the location of the cell as well as the data pattern
stored in all of the ReRAM cells in the array. A write is considered
reliable if it modifies the content of the selected cells to the new value
without disturbing other unselected cells. Correspondingly, there are two
potential problems with writes: \emph{write failure}, an unsuccessful
write on selected cells, and \emph{write disturbance}, an undesirable
write to unselected cells. It is necessary to ensure that a write scheme
guarantees reliable operation even in the worst case (w.r.t the location
of cells to written and the data pattern stored in the cross-point array).

%We first use an example to show the problem with FWFB scheme, which may
%result in severe write disturbance. Figure~\ref{fig:FWFR} shows the
%voltage drop across each ReRAM cell of a $64 \times 64$ cross-point array.
%In this example, in order to write the cell at the cross point of the
%$32^{nd}$ wordline and the $32^{nd}$ bitline, the selected wordline and
%bitline are biased at 2V and 0V, respectively. All of the other wordlines
%and bitlines are left floating. The ReRAM cells at the selected bitline are
%in the HRS, while all of the other cells are in the LRS. It is clear that
%the voltage drop across the selected cell ($V_{32,32}$) almost has the
%same magnitude as the unselected cell at the same bitline, resulting the
%write disturbance to all of the unselected cells at the selected bitline.
%Actually, for a $M \times N$ matrix ($M>N$), the worst case voltage drop
%of the unselected cell can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}\label{worst_FWFB}
%V_{worst}=V_{select} \cdot [1-\frac{1}{M+(N-1)R_{off}/R_{on}}].
%\end{equation}

%  \caption{Write disturbance for FWFB schemes. ( $V_{W32} = 2V$, $V_{B32} = 0V$. $R_{x,32}$ at HRS, others at LRS.) }\label{fig:FWFR}
%\end{figure}
%Considering that the reported On-OFF resistance ratio of
%ReRAM cell is always $>50$ ~\cite{ReRAM_IEDM2010_Ho,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Chien,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Diode,ReRAM_IEDM2010_Lee_Evidence,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Sheu,ReRAM_ISSCC2011_Otsuka},
%, the worst case voltage drop at the unselected cell is larger than $98\%$ of the voltage at the selected cell, making it is impossible to build a reliable cross-point structure ReRAM with the FWFB scheme. Therefore, in the following discussion, we only compare the results of FWHB, HWFB and HWHB schemes. For each of these three schemes, we can either write the cells at one wordline at the same time or only write one bit per access and separate the write operation to several arrays. In the
%following discussion, we start from one bit per access write operation,
%then the results of one wordline per access method are discussed.


%as long all of unselected cells in the activated wordline (or all of unselected cells in the activated bitline) are at HRS and other cells are in LRS, the voltage drop at unselected cells are mainly applied at the HRS cells at the wordline (or bitline).
%The worse case scenario for FWFB write disturbance can be defined as: all of unselected cells in the activated wordline (or all of unselected cells in the activated bitline) are at HRS and other cells are in LRS. In this case, the voltage drop at unselected cells are mainly applied at the HRS cells at the wordline (or bitline).

Write failure typically results from the voltage drop at the interconnect
wires along the wordline and bitline. It has been shown that, for
single-bit write operation, the worst case voltage drop occurs when
writing the cell at the cross point of the $M^{th}$ wordline and the
$N^{th}$ bitline with all of the other cells in the array are in
LRS~\cite{crossbar_TED_2010}. In order to avoid write failure and
successfully program the selected ReRAM cell, the driven voltage should be
boosted to a higher level, making sure that the voltage across the cell
exceeds the threshold voltage even at the worst case.
Figure~\ref{fig:worst_v} shows the lower bounds of the driven voltage for
different sizes of cross-point array. The minimum wordline/bitline voltage
increases from 2.01~V for a $32 \times 32$ array to nearly 7~V for a $1024
\times 1024$ cross-point array. However, boosting the driven voltage also
increases the voltage applied at unselected cells. Therefore, a write
disturbance may occur when the voltage applied at an unselected cell
exceeds the threshold voltage for SET or RESET operation. According to our
analysis, the maximum voltage applied at unselect cells is exactly the
same as half of the driven voltage. Thus, only arrays with driven voltage
less than 4V are allowable. Otherwise, the array is unreliable because it
cannot avoid write failure and write disturbance at the same time. The
unreliable array sizes are denoted as red bars in
Figure~\ref{fig:worst_v}. The array size limitation provided by
Figure~\ref{fig:worst_v} is a hard constraint, and all of the following
energy and area trade-offs are bounded by this constraint.

Additionally, the cross-point array can be organized with a different
number of wordlines and bitlines. For example, a 256K bit cross-point
array can be implemented either by a $512 \times 512$ array or by a $64
\times 4096$ array. In the latter case, the voltage drops along the
wordline will be much worse than along the bitline. Figure~\ref{fig:shape}
examines the voltage requirements for different array organizations with
different write schemes. This result shows that from a reliability point
of view, a cross-point array with the same number of wordlines and
bitlines is the best choice. Thus, in the following discuss, we assume the
array has the same number of wordline and bitline. Furthermore, we also
notice that when the array has the same number of wordlines and bitlines,
FWFB, HWFB and FWHB schemes have the same minimum driven voltage.

%Figure~\ref{fig:half} shows the maximum voltage applied at unselected

%2V, only array sizes with worst case unselected cell voltage less than 2V
%are allowable. Otherwise, the array is unreliable because it can not avoid
%write failure and write disturbance at the same time. Therefore,
%Figure~\ref{fig:half} provides a hard constraint on array size, and all of
%the following energy and area tradeoffs should be bounded by this
%constraint.

\vspace{5pt}\noindent\textbf{Energy Consumption of Write Operations.}
%
%The energy consumption of a write operation for a cross-point array can be calculated as:
%\begin{equation}
%E_{write} = E_{select} + E_{unselect} + E_{halfselect} + E_{line},
%\end{equation}
%where the $E_{select}$ is the energy consumed to change the state of the
%selected cell, the $E_{unselect}$ and $E_{halfselect}$ are the undesired
%energy wasted at the half selected and unselected cells. The energy
%consumed by the interconnect lines are represented by $E_{line}$.
%Figure~\ref{fig:energy} shows the decomposed energy consumption for the
%cross-point array. Note that, the $E_{line}$ and $E_{halfselect}$ take a
%large amount of the total energy consumption. Also, this part of energy
%wasted during the write operation takes greater part of the total energy
%for larger array sizes. For example, the undesired energy consumption for
%writing a $128{\times}128$ array is more than 1000 times larger than the
%$8{\times}8$ array. We also notice that, since the impact of sneak paths
%for floating schemes (FWHB and HWFB) is more serious, the energy consumed
%at unselected cells for floating schemes is larger than the half-biased
%scheme. Due to this reason, the total energy consumptions for FWHB and
%HWFB schemes are at least 10\% larger than that of HWHB scheme.
The energy consumption of a write operation includes: the energy consumed
to change the state of the selected cell, the undesired energy wasted at
the half selected cells and unselected cells, and the energy consumed by
the interconnect lines. Intuitively, the impact of sneak paths for
floating schemes (FWHB and HWFB) is more serious, the energy consumed at
unselected cells for floating schemes should be larger than the HWHB
scheme. However, our simulation results show that compared to the total
energy consumption, the energy consumed by unselected cells are
negligible. Therefore, the total energy consumptions for FWHB and HWFB
schemes are almost the same as that of HWHB scheme. In addition, as
mentioned, the voltage drop results for these schemes are also similar, in
the following discussion, we only show the simulation results of HWHB
scheme. The results for the other two schemes have the same trend as that
of HWHB scheme.

Figure~\ref{fig:energy}(a) shows the decomposed energy consumption for
single-bit write operation. Obviously, the undesired energy consumed by
half-selected cells takes a great part of the total energy consumption.
Besides, with the increase of array size, the energy dissipated at
interconnect lines also becomes significant. Also, this part of the energy
wasted during the write operation is a greater part of the total energy
for larger array sizes. For example, the undesired energy consumption for
writing a $512{\times}512$ array is more than 15 times larger than that of
a $32{\times}32$ array. For multi-bit write operation, we evaluate the
energy consumption of write operations that program the entire wordline at
one time. In order to fairly compare the energy consumption, we compare
the energy-per-bit instead of the total energy. For example, in order to
write a wordline with size of 512 bits, the energy-per-bit can be
calculated as: $E_{ave}=E_{total}/512$. Figure~\ref{fig:energy}(b) shows
the energy-per-bit of the multi-bit write operation. Compared with the
single-bit write operation, we conclude that for large cross-point array
sizes, the multi-bit write operation is much more energy efficient. This
is because the energy wasted at the unselected and half-selected cells are
amortized by multiple bits and the average energy for one bit is therefore
reduced.

\end{figure}

\vspace{5pt}\noindent\textbf{Write Current and Area Overhead of Write Operations.}
%\vspace{6pt}
%
The write operation for a $M \times N$ array requires $M$ wordline voltage
drivers and $N$ bitline multiplexors. The drivers and multiplexors should
be sized such that they can provide the worst-case current of wordline
current and bitline current. The transistor sizing of the wordline/bitline
circuitry is achieved using HSPICE simulations. We further calculate the
area overhead for the drivers and multiplexors by referring to the CACTI
area model. Figure~\ref{fig:drive_i}(a) shows the maximum write current
with different ReRAM array sizes. Not surprisingly, the current
requirement increases as the array size increases.
Figure~\ref{fig:area_i}(a) illustrates the area overhead for the wordline
and bitline circuitry. This show that drivers and multiplexors occupy a
smaller area than the cross-point array. Only in this case can voltage
drivers and multiplexors be implemented beneath the array, resulting an
ideal cell size of $4F^2$.

Although multi-bit write operation has the advantage of lower energy
consumption, the maximum current requirement for each wordline also
increases. As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:drive_i}(b), although the
maximum driven current for each bitline is almost the same as when writing
one bit, the driving current requirement for each wordline in a multi-bit
write scheme is $>10$ times larger than that of a single-bit write scheme.
Since the area of the voltage driver increases proportionally with its
driving current, the area overhead for multi-bit writing is much larger
than that of single-bit writing. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:area_i}(b),
the peripheral circuitry area is much larger than that of the array. In
this case, the total area of the memory array is dominated by the
peripheral circuitry rather than the cells. In addition to the extra area
overhead, writing multiple bits at one time also worsens the voltage drop
along the wordline. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reliable_region}, in order
to write an entire wordline when writing, the maximum reliable array size
reduces from $800 \times 800$ to $352 \times 352$. This is because the
current passing through the interconnect wires in the multi-bit write
scheme is much larger than that of the single-bit write scheme, causing
more severe voltage drops on the wire resistance.

Therefore, we conclude that although the multi-bit write operation is more
energy efficient, from the standpoint of reliability and area overhead,
single-bit write operation is preferred.

%\vspace{5pt}\noindent\textbf{Discussion on Multi-Bits Write Operation.} %\vspace{2pt}
%
%So far, we have only discussed the write operation with one bit per
%access. In this section, we compare the difference between single-bit per
%access and multi-bit per access write operations.
%
%First of all, we evaluate the energy consumption of write operations that
%program the entire wordline at one time. In order to fairly compare the
%energy consumption, we compare the energy-per-bit instead of the total
%energy. For example, in order to write a wordline with size of 512 bits,
%the energy-per-bit can be calculated as: $E_{ave}=E_{total}/512$.

%Figure~\ref{fig:energy}(b) shows the energy-per-bit of the multi-bit write
%operation. Compared with the single-bit write operation as shown in
%Figure~\ref{fig:energy}(a), we conclude that for large cross point array
%sizes, the multi-bit write operation is much more energy efficient. This
%is because the energy wasted at the unselected and half-selected cells are
%amortized by multiple bits and the average energy for one bit is therefore
%reduced.

%%However, although multi-bit write operation has the advantage of lower
%%energy consumption, the maximum current requirement for each wordline also
%%increases. As demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:drive_i}(b), although the
%%maximum driven current for each bitline is almost the same as when writing

%%than that of single-bit writing. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:area_i}(b),
%%the peripheral circuitry area is much larger than that of the array. In
%%this case, the total area of the memory array is dominated by the

%%In addition to the extra area overhead, writing multiple bits at one time
%%also worsens the voltage drop along the wordline. As shown in
%%Figure~\ref{fig:reliable_region}, in order to write an entire wordline
%%when writing, the maximum reliable array size reduces from $800 \times

%%Therefore, we conclude that although the multi-bit write operation is more

%Figure~9(b) shows that for a $512\times 512$ cross-point array, the worst-case voltage drop increases and eventually become unreliable as we increase the number of bits per write operation. The maximum of bits that can be accessed simultaneously while maintaining reliable write operation is about 130.

%Therefore, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:reliable_region},
%Therefore the simulation results show that the reliable size of the
%cross-point array will be further reduced. The maximum array size reduces
%from $116{\times}116$ to $100{\times}100$ for HWFB and HWFB schemes.
%For the energy consumption point of view, the one wordline write operation is more efficient.

In this section we apply a similar sensing scheme as
\cite{crossbar_NANO08_Flocke} and \cite{crossbar_TED_2010}. In order to
read cell $R_{i,j}$, the $i^{th}$ wordline is biased at $V_{READ}$ and all of the other wordlines and bitlines are grounded. Then the state of the
selected cell is read out by measuring the voltage across $R_s$. The
energy consumption for a read operation can be analyzed similarly as
a write operation. Since the read voltage is much smaller than
write voltage, the read energy is expected to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than for a write operation. Considerable sensing margin is achieved by implementing a current-to-voltage converter and sensing the voltage signal using traditional or more recent sense amplifier designs. The input resistance of the current-to-voltage converter is extracted from HSPICE simulation results. Read sensing margin is defined as $\Delta V = \Delta I \times R_{converter}$ where $R_{converter}$ is the input resistance of the converter.
The read reliability is determined by the voltage swing for reading HRS
and LRS cells.
%In order to improve the reliability of the read operation, a two-step sensing scheme can be applied~\cite{memristor:Cong}, which senses the current of an unselected cell first, then the overall current is sensed, and after that the current difference is converted to the output voltage.
Detailed results will be shown in Section~\ref{sec:scale}.

%Additionally, since the read voltage/current is much lower than the write voltage/current, we believe that the voltage drivers can always provide enough current for the read operation if they meet the current requirement for write operation. Therefore, we can conclude that the area overhead of voltage drivers is determined by the write current. However, the reliability of read operation is different from the write operation. Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin_basic} (a) shows the voltage swing with different array sizes. Specifically, larger cross-point array have more sneak paths, making the output voltage very sensitive to the data pattern of unselected cell. Therefore, the sense margin decreases with the increase of array size.  The voltage swing of this two-step sensing scheme is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin_basic} (b). By using this two-step sensing schemes, the voltage swing for a given array size and nonlinearity coefficient is doubled.

%\subsection{Read Operation}
%In this section we applied the similar sensing scheme as
%\cite{crossbar_TED_2010} and \cite{crossbar_NANO08_Flocke}. In order to
%read cell $R_{i,j}$, the $i^{th}$ wordline is biased at $V_{READ}$ and all
%of the other wordlines and bitlines are grounded. Then the state of the
%selected cell is read out by measuring the voltage across $R_s$. The
%energy consumption for read operation can be analyzed by the same way as
%that of the write operation. Since the read voltage is much smaller than
%write voltage, the read energy is expected at least one order smaller than
%write operation. Additionally, since the read voltage/current is much
%lower than the write, we believe that the voltage drivers can always
%provide enough current for the read operation if they meet the current
%requirement for write operation. Therefore, we can conclude that the area
%overhead of voltage drivers is determined by the write current. However,
%the reliability of read operation is different from the write operation.
%The read reliability is determined by the voltage swing for reading HRS
%and LRS cells. Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (a) shows the voltage swing
%with different array sizes and $K_r$ values. Large array sizes and large
%nonlinearity are harmful to the voltage swing: on the one hand, a larger
%array has more sneak paths, making the output voltage very sensitive to
%the data pattern of unselected cells; on the other hand, the nonlinearity
%increases the resistance of LRS and therefore the resistance difference
%between HRS and LRS cells is reduced. In order to improve the reliability
%of the read operation, a two-step sensing scheme can be applied, which
%senses the current of an unselected cell first, then the overall current
%is sensed, and after that the current difference is converted to the
%output voltage. The voltage swing of this two-step sensing scheme is shown
%in Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (b). By using this two-step sensing
%schemes, the voltage swing for a given array size and nonlinearity
%coefficient is doubled.
