One of the most distinct features of ReRAM is its nonlinearity. Normally,
the $K_r$ value for memristor-based ReRAM is larger than 20, meaning that
the resistance of a half-biased cell is at least 10 times larger than a
full-biased cell. Clearly, ReRAM cells with larger nonlinearity
coefficients result in a better memory cell since the sneak current in
half selected cells will be significantly reduced. In addition, the
increased resistance at half-selected and unselected cells can also
mitigate the voltage drop along the activated wordline and bitline. Also,
we find that the cross-point array design can benefit from the scaling of
the write current. Figure~\ref{fig:non_linear} shows the influence of
different nonlinearity coefficients and write currents on the array size
requirements for a single-bit HWHB writing scheme. This figure shows that
the array size limitation is relaxed as the nonlinearity increases or the
write current scales. As we can see from the figure, the maximum array
size exceeds $1024\times 1024$ when we have a nonlinearity of $30$,
together with a write current of $40\mu A$.

Moreover, the increase of nonlinearity or scaling of write current can
also reduce the energy consumption and area overhead of the cross-point
array. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:E_and_A}(a), for a $512 \times 512$
array, the energy consumption for the write operation decreases
dramatically with the scaling of nonlinearity coefficient $K_r$. For
example, for a ReRAM cell with write current of 50uA, the write energy is
reduced by 98.3\% when $K_r$ increases from 2 to 40. The area overhead of
the voltage drivers is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:E_and_A}(b). As a
baseline design ($K_r=20$ and $I_w=40\mu A$), the driver area overhead is
about 35\% of the area of the memory array cells. To design a memory array
with an effective cell size close to $4F^2$, we need to make sure the
nonlinearity and write current should satisfy certain conditions so that
the driver overhead is less than 100\% and the wordline drivers can be
almost ``hidden'' underneath the ReRAM cells. As nonlinearity and write
current continues to scale, the area overhead can be as low as 10\%. In
that case, the introduction of 3D stacking of multi-layer cross-point
arrays is productive in further reduce the effective cell size to $4/N_l
F^2$ where $N_l$ is the number of layers.

%Therefore, we can conclude that, the ReRAM cells with a small nonlinearity coefficient are not suitable for the cross-point structure based memory array. Next, we study the area overhead of multi-bit write. Figure~\ref{fig:Area_kr20} shows the normalized areas of the voltage drivers for one bit and multi-bit write operations. As mentioned, multi-bit write operations require larger driven current. Therefore, the area of voltage drivers for multi-bit write operations are much larger than that for one bit write operations. Finally, normalized areas of the one bit and multi-bit write operations have opposite trends as the array size increases. Normalized area for one bit write operation increases with the array size. On the contrary, normalized area for multi-bit write decreases as the array size increase.}

Unlike the write operation, the read operation suffers, rather than
benefits, from scaling of nonlinearity or write current. This is because
the scaling of nonlinearity and write current will reduce read current,
degrading the read signal ratio. Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin}(a) shows
the read noise margin with different array sizes for the baseline design
in Section~\ref{sec:w_and_r}.  As can be seen, the read noise margin is
reduced for large array sizes. The impact of nonlinearity and write
current on read noise margin is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin}(b). A large $K_r$ value and small write
current are harmful to the read noise margin. For example, given a $512
\times 512$ array, the read noise margin is less than $10mV$ for $K_r=40$
and $I_w=40\mu A$, which makes it very difficult to sense the state of the
selected memory cell using traditional sense amplifiers.

%the nonlinearity increases the resistance of half LRS and therefore the
%resistance difference between HRS and LRS cells is reduced; on the other
%hand, .

Therefore, by given the array size and read noise margin constraints, an
``optimal cell'' with nonlinearity of $K_{r\_opt}$ and write current of
$I_{on\_opt}$ can be determined. For example, when the array size is fixed
at $512 \times 512$ and the minimum noise margin is $50mV$, a cross-point
array with ReRAM cells which have $K_{r\_opt} = 9$ and $I_{on\_opt} =
40mA$ is the most energy and area efficient design.


%\subsection{Read Operation}
%In this section we applied the similar sensing scheme as
%\cite{crossbar_TED_2010} and \cite{crossbar_NANO08_Flocke}. In order to
%read cell $R_{i,j}$, the $i^{th}$ wordline is biased at $V_{READ}$ and all
%of the other wordlines and bitlines are grounded. Then the state of the
%selected cell is read out by measuring the voltage across $R_s$. The
%energy consumption for read operation can be analyzed by the same way as
%that of the write operation. Since the read voltage is much smaller than
%write voltage, the read energy is expected at least one order smaller than
%write operation. Additionally, since the read voltage/current is much
%lower than the write, we believe that the voltage drivers can always
%provide enough current for the read operation if they meet the current
%requirement for write operation. Therefore, we can conclude that the area
%overhead of voltage drivers is determined by the write current. However,
%the reliability of read operation is different from the write operation.
%The read reliability is determined by the voltage swing for reading HRS
%and LRS cells. Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (a) shows the voltage swing
%with different array sizes and $K_r$ values. Large array sizes and large
%nonlinearity are harmful to the voltage swing: on the one hand, a larger
%array has more sneak paths, making the output voltage very sensitive to
%the data pattern of unselected cells; on the other hand, the nonlinearity
%increases the resistance of LRS and therefore the resistance difference
%between HRS and LRS cells is reduced. In order to improve the reliability
%of the read operation, a two-step sensing scheme can be applied, which
%senses the current of an unselected cell first, then the overall current
%is sensed, and after that the current difference is converted to the
%output voltage. The voltage swing of this two-step sensing scheme is shown
%in Figure~\ref{fig:sense_margin} (b). By using this two-step sensing
%schemes, the voltage swing for a given array size and nonlinearity
%coefficient is doubled.
